## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I would like to create a random encounter generator for D&D. I have a number of friends 
that play D&D and would eventually like to create a DM suite that will allow someone to run
a campaign without needed all the books required. The application will also allow quicker
game play and less preparation for each session.

Set Encounters - Have predefined tables that will allow quick encounter generation.
Flexible Encounters - Have variables that can be set to allow customization of the encounters.
Random Table - Allow the user to crate their own custom table to generate encounters from.

### Technologies
Java
MySQL
Thymeleaf
Possibly Javascript
Html/css

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am going to try and learn some javascript to help with the design of the applicaion.
